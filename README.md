# Solver of quadratic equations 

This script was created for solving quadratic equation and getting its roots.


# How to use

Use python-cli for getting results:
```python
>>> import quadratic_equation
>>> quadratic_equation.get_roots(1, 2, -3)
(-3.0, 1.0)
>>> quadratic_equation.get_roots(2, 1, 3)
(None, None)
>>> quadratic_equation.get_roots(2, 1, -1)
(-1.0, 0.5)
>>> 
```

# How to run tests
```python
python tests.py
```
